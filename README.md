This repository contains code for a Microsoft Movie Studio project. The project aims to provide actionable insights that the head of Microsoft's new movie studio can use to help decide what type of films to create.

#Introduction and Business Problem**
Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content and they want to get in on the fun. 
They have decided to create a new movie studio, but they donâ€™t know anything about creating movies. 

The repository contains a Jupyter Notebook with the code necessary to answer three questions;
1. Which are the genres of the 10 most voted movies that Microsoft should consider starting out with and what is the average domestic gross and foreign gross of those genres?
2. Which are the 10 top most average foreign and domestic grossing genres which Microsoft should also consider starting out with?
3. Which studios had on average most voted movies produced that Microsoft can collaborate with in producing movies?
Additionally, a Power Point Presentation is provided to provide at glance view of the answers
